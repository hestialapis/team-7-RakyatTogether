# RakyatTogether

RakyatTogether website is inspired by our real life experience of trying to read up information around the country related to the COVID-19 pandemic and National Recovery Plan. Our platform serves as a one-stop hub for communicating with our fellow Malaysians with a priority on welfare and communal unity. RakyatTogether aims to facilitate non-entertainment discussion and propagation of information regarding vaccination, public announcement, food aid, and other forms of services that we must learn to handle in a recovering nation.
